# Signing Free Agents
This was a final project for an algorithms class. The goal was to create a algorithm that would take in a list of baseball players and return the best possible free agents to sign in order to maximize the VORP (value over replacement player).

# Prompt
Sign some free-agent players for a baseball team: you have to stay within a budget of $X, while maximizing the total VORP of the players you signed. This problem is more complex than the rod-cutting example: you are consuming not one, but 3 limited resources (open positions, players and money), in order to maximize the value for the team. Even if the coded solution is quite short, coming up with the right recurrence is not as easy as it sounds. Some work is involved in designing meaningful test cases: coding the brute-force solution should be part of this prepatory step.

This problem is an instance of a larger, and well-studied class of optimization problems called Knapsack-problems: it might be helpful to read a bit about those before you tackle this project. There are many variants: try to identify the type of Knapsack-problem that is closest to yours, and adapt the solution.
